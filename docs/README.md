# `docs/`: Mini-site (GitHub Pages)

🌐 English · [Português (Brasil)](README.pt-br.md)

📖 **Navigation:** [🏠 Index](../README.md)

Static site that presents the kit. Landing content is centralized in [`content.json`](content.json) and rendered by [`app.js`](app.js), with three public routes:

| Route | Language | Shell |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | PT-BR | [`index.html`](index.html) |
| `/en/` | English | [`en/index.html`](en/index.html) |
| `/es/` | Español | [`es/index.html`](es/index.html) |

## Public URL

```text
https://paulasilvatech.github.io/ai-maturity-client-kit/
```

## Architecture

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`content.json`](content.json) | Single source for PT-BR, EN, and ES text, including hero, pipeline, cards, FAQ, skills, and downloads |
| [`app.js`](app.js) | Static renderer: loads the JSON, picks the language from the route, and builds the page |
| [`index.html`](index.html) | PT-BR shell with browser language auto-detection |
| [`en/index.html`](en/index.html) | EN shell |
| [`es/index.html`](es/index.html) | ES shell |
| [`styles.css`](styles.css) | Shared CSS with paulasilva-ms tokens |

## Automatic language

The `/` route uses the browser language to redirect to `/en/` or `/es/` when appropriate. PT-BR remains the default for this route.

The PT · EN · ES selector stores the choice in `localStorage`, so future visits respect the last selection.

## Editing content

Edit only [`content.json`](content.json) to change text and translations. Avoid hand-editing the three HTML files; they are minimal shells.

Validate the JSON before publishing:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool docs/content.json >/dev/null
```

## Local preview

The site loads `content.json` through `fetch`, so use a local server:

```bash
cd docs
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

Opening `index.html` directly via `file://` is not recommended, because browsers block `fetch()` for local files.

## Public downloads with a private repo

Yes, the repository can stay private while the site is public, as long as GitHub Pages is enabled as public in the plan or organization.

The important detail: GitHub Releases assets in a private repository require authentication. That is why the Pages workflow builds the ZIPs and publishes them inside the site artifact itself:

```text
https://paulasilvatech.github.io/ai-maturity-client-kit/downloads/ai-maturity-kit-pt.zip
https://paulasilvatech.github.io/ai-maturity-client-kit/downloads/ai-maturity-kit-en.zip
https://paulasilvatech.github.io/ai-maturity-client-kit/downloads/ai-maturity-kit-es.zip
```

These links stay public with the site, even if the repository goes back to private.

Package languages: the PT ZIP ships the Portuguese copies (`*.pt-br.md`, `*.pt-br.html`) under their base names; the EN and ES ZIPs ship the English repository docs plus the `kit-en/` or `kit-es/` guides. Generated reports default to English in every package (set `metadata.language` to `"pt-BR"` or `"es"` to change it).

## Deploy

The workflow [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](../.github/workflows/pages.yml):

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Builds the three ZIPs in `docs/downloads/`.
3. Uploads the `docs/` folder as the GitHub Pages artifact.
4. Publishes the site.

Any push that touches `docs/**` or the Pages workflow triggers a new deploy.
