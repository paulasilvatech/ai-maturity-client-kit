# AI Maturity Assessment, Pillar P2: Ciclo de Vida DevOps (DevOps Lifecycle)

> Measures the maturity of pipelines, infrastructure as code, observability, DevSecOps, releases, testing, incidents, and supply chain security.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Runtime-safe localized edition: structural labels are in English and all IDs are preserved.
> The canonical question wording (the text in each `P2-Cx-Qy` heading) stays in Portuguese, byte-identical to the Microsoft Forms question bank, to keep strict scoring and audit parity with the workbook.

## Overview

- **Pillar:** `P2`, Ciclo de Vida DevOps (DevOps Lifecycle)
- **Capabilities:** 10
- **Total questions:** 59
- **Scale:** Likert L0–L4 (Initial → Optimizing)
- **Question language:** Portuguese (Brazil), canonical wording preserved in every edition
- **KPI/context/evidence language:** English (universal technical terms)
- **Expected answer per question:** 1 selected level + evidence text (recommended minimum 80 characters) + optional attachment

## How to interpret the scale

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **L0** | Initial | No established practice; ad-hoc actions, no tool or policy. |
| **L1** | Developing | Isolated pilots, coverage <25%, no governance. |
| **L2** | Defined | Adoption in 25–50% of teams, with guidelines and basic training. |
| **L3** | Managed | Coverage >75% with impact metrics and shared libraries/templates. |
| **L4** | Optimizing | Near-universal coverage (>95%), automation, fine-tuning, measured continuous improvement. |

## Types of information collected per question

Each question simultaneously captures **three types of data**:

1. **Quantitative (KPI):** an explicit numeric metric (e.g., % active developers, MTTR, lead time, coverage rate). Use the suggested KPI to standardize comparison across teams.

2. **Qualitative (level description):** the respondent selects the L0–L4 level whose description best represents the reality observed today (not the aspirational one).

3. **Evidence (text + attachments):** documentary proof: pipeline link, dashboard screenshot, policy, runbook, license contract, exported metric. The more specific, the higher the evidence quality (scale: none → minimal → adequate → detailed → exemplary).

## Evidence quality criteria

- **Minimal (<80 characters):** generic text, no tool name, metric, or link.
- **Adequate (80–250):** mentions tool + approximate coverage/scope.
- **Detailed (250–500):** includes numeric metric + link/attachment + measurement period.
- **Exemplary (>500 or multiple attachments):** multiple corroborating sources, time series, before/after comparison.

## How this section is scored

- Each question receives a numeric value from the selected level: L0=0, L1=1, L2=2, L3=3, L4=4.
- The capability score is the weighted average of its questions (default weight = 1.0; questions with weight 1.5 or 2.0 count more).
- The **P2** pillar score is the average of the 10 capabilities.
- The result is displayed on a 0–4 scale and converted to maturity % (level / 4 × 100).

## Quick glossary

- **Pillar:** strategic maturity dimension.
- **Capability:** functional subdomain within a pillar.
- **Question:** concrete assessment item, standard ID `P[1-3]-C[1-19]-Q[1-99]`.
- **Level (L0–L4):** point on the maturity Likert scale.
- **KPI:** key indicator that objectively validates the declared level.
- **Evidence:** qualitative (text) or quantitative (attachment) proof that supports the answer.
