# `survey-devs/`: Developer Survey (anonymous, behavioral, individual)

🌐 English · [Português (Brasil)](README.pt-br.md)

This folder contains a **survey separate** from the main assessment. It focuses on understanding **how each developer uses GitHub Copilot, AI agents, instructions files, Copilot Chat modes, practices (TDD/SDD), governance, and security** day to day. Anonymous.

> 💡 **Companion to this survey:** after running **survey-devs** (anonymous, measures behavior), also consider **[survey-learning](../survey-learning/)** (identified, measures what developers want to learn). Together they form a 360° view of developers: behavioral plus aspirational.

> 🔄 **Version 2.0 (updated 2026-05-08)**: terminology updated with official changes:
> - **Copilot Workspace** evolved into **Copilot Coding Agent** (GA Sep/2025)
> - **Copilot Spaces** (GA Sep/2025) replaced **Knowledge Bases** (sunset Nov/2025)
> - **Azure AI Foundry** renamed to **Microsoft Foundry** + **Foundry Agent Service** GA
> - Added questions about **MCP**, **A2A protocol**, Microsoft Agentic DevOps personas (**System Designer**, **Agent Operator**), **testing agents before using them**, **scope+red-lines**, and **JIT permissions**.

## 📐 Difference vs. the main assessment and survey-learning

| Aspect | Main assessment | Developer Survey (this one) | **survey-learning** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Audience** | Leadership / architects / Tech Leads | **Individual developers** (any role) | Individual developers |
| **Anonymous?** | No, identified by organization | **Yes, anonymous Forms** | **No, IDENTIFIED (name+email)** |
| **Focus** | Organizational maturity (L0-L4) | Real individual adoption and practice | **What they want to LEARN** |
| **Scale** | 5-point Likert per capability | Choice/multi-choice/free text | Self-perception L0-L4 + multi |
| **Size** | 158 questions across 28 capabilities | **75 questions in 9 sections** | 32 questions in 7 sections |
| **Time per respondent** | 60-90 min | **22-28 min** | 5-8 min |
| **Multi-respondent** | Possible but not the default | **Essential** (average ≥5, ideal ≥15) | **Essential** (>50% of the team) |
| **Output** | Executive report + 5 PDFs | Insights report + computed maturity | Capacitation plan + Champions |
| **Skills** | `/calcular-scores`, `/gerar-relatorio`, etc. | `/importar-survey-devs` + `/insights-developer-survey` | [`/importar-survey-learning`](../survey-learning/) + `/plano-capacitacao` |

**The 3 are complementary:**
- This **survey-devs** measures BEHAVIOR (anonymous)
- **[survey-learning](../survey-learning/)** measures DESIRE (identified, complements this one)
- The **main assessment** measures STRATEGY (leadership)
- Together they form a 360° diagnosis.

| **[perguntas-para-forms-devs.en.md](perguntas-para-forms-devs.en.md)** | The 75 questions in English, formatted for copy/paste into Forms (types, options, IDs). The canonical PT-BR bank is [perguntas-para-forms-devs.md](perguntas-para-forms-devs.md) |

| **[scripts/rubric.py](scripts/rubric.py)** | Python implementation of the rubric (hardcoded rules per dimension) |
| **[scripts/calcular_maturidade.py](scripts/calcular_maturidade.py)** | CLI script that applies the rubric → `saida/maturidade-developer-survey-DATE.json` |

## 🚀 Usage flow (3 paths)

### Path A: Microsoft Forms (recommended for 10+ developers)

```
1. Build the Forms following INSTRUCOES-FORMS-DEVS.md (~30-45 min)
2. Share the link with the team (Slack/Teams/Email)
3. Wait 2 weeks (periodic reminders)
4. Responses → Open in Excel
5. Save as respostas-survey-devs.xlsx at the root of kit-cliente/
6. /importar-survey-devs       → survey-devs/respostas-devs.json
7. /insights-developer-survey  → saida/insights-developer-survey-DATE.md
```

### Path B: Shared Excel/SharePoint (fast for 3-5 developers)

```
1. cp survey-devs/template-export-forms-devs.xlsx respostas-survey-devs.xlsx
2. Clear the mock rows (rows 2-6)
3. Upload to SharePoint with edit permission
4. Each developer fills in one row
5. Download and move to the root
6. /importar-survey-devs + /insights-developer-survey
```

### Path C: Immediate smoke test (no real collection)

```
1. cp survey-devs/respostas-mock-devs.json survey-devs/respostas-devs.json
2. /insights-developer-survey  → see what the report looks like with 5 mocks
```

Useful to show the client "what it will look like" before collecting.

## 📊 What the insights report contains

`saida/insights-developer-survey-<DATE>.md` (generated by the skill) is written in **English by default**; run the scripts with `--lang pt-br` to get it in Portuguese (Brazil). It contains:

1. **Executive summary**: 3 insights + 3 gaps + perceived maturity
2. **Demographics** (S1): who answered, distribution
3. **Copilot adoption** (S2): % of licenses, **adoption by mode (Ask/Edit/Agent)**, active features, perceived gain
4. **MS/GitHub ecosystem** (S3): adoption table
5. **AI + dev practices** (S4): TDD, SDD, debugging, onboarding + anonymized quotes
6. **Agent knowledge** (S5): "knows+uses / knows / does not know" matrix for 8 concepts
7. **Instructions files** (S6): who uses, maintains, and updates them
8. **Usability** (S7): Champion, metrics, trust, iterations
9. **Security** (S8): policy, scanners, DLP, audit + **governance score 0-100**
10. **Pain points** (S9): top 5 frustrations + wishlist (quotes)
11. **Prioritized recommendations**: quick wins, next quarter, semester
12. **Connection to the main assessment**: capability by capability

## 🔗 How the survey informs the main assessment

If you ran both:

| Assessment capability | Survey signal | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| **P1-C1** AI Coding Assistants | S2-Q1, Q2, Q7 | Declared score vs. real adoption |
| **P1-C2** DevEx Platform | S6-Q5, S7-Q2 | Is there shared tooling? |
| **P1-C5** Onboarding and Training | S7-Q1, Q2 | How did developers learn? Are there Champions? |
| **P1-C8** Productivity Measurement | S7-Q4 | Are DORA/DX/SPACE really measured? |
| **P2-C4** DevSecOps | S8-Q4, Q5, Q11 | Active scanners vs. vulnerabilities seen |
| **P2-C10** Supply Chain | S8-Q4, Q6 | SBOM, secret scanning, DLP |
| **P3-C5** Agentic Applications | S5-Q3, Q6, Q9 | Custom agents, MCP: technical sophistication |
| **P3-C6** Identity and Access | S8-Q1, Q8, Q9 | Policy, DLP, audit |

> 💡 **Classic use case:** leadership rates P1-C1 as L3, but the survey reveals that 60% of developers rarely use it. That is a real adoption gap, not a licensing gap.

## 🔐 About anonymity

- Microsoft Forms has an "Anonymous responses" option: **CHECKING it is mandatory** for this survey
- Without it, Forms captures the respondent's MS365 account email (breaks anonymity)
- The `/importar-survey-devs` skill validates that the Email/Name columns are empty and warns if they are not
- Quotes in the report are cited by **question ID** (e.g., "Answer S9-Q1"), never by respondent_id or role

## 📅 Suggested cadence

- **First time:** before defining the AI strategy for engineering (baseline)
- **After a Copilot Enterprise rollout:** 30 days later
- **Quarterly:** measure evolution
- **After workshops/training:** validate absorption
