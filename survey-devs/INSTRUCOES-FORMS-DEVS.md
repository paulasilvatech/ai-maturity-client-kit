**`🅱️ SURVEY-DEVS`** · _anonymous_ · 📖 [🏠 Index](../README.md) · [« Main collection](../coleta/INSTRUCOES-FORMS.md) · You are here · [» Learning Survey](../survey-learning/INSTRUCOES-FORMS-LEARNING.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An **anonymous** survey of **75 questions** in 9 sections to understand how the developers in your organization use GitHub Copilot, Copilot Chat modes (Ask/Edit/Agent/**Coding Agent**), **Copilot Spaces**, **Microsoft Foundry**, AI agents + **MCP / A2A**, instructions files, practices (TDD/SDD with Spec Kit), **Agentic DevOps personas** (System Designer / Agent Operator), governance, and security (incl. **JIT permissions** and **agent scope+red-lines**). Estimated time per respondent: **22-28 min**.

**Version 2.0 (2026-05-08)**: terms updated with the latest official Microsoft/GitHub docs.

**Different from the main assessment** (organizational Likert L0-L4). This one is **individual and behavioral**: the more developers respond, the richer the picture.

---

## 🎯 When to use this survey

- ✅ Before defining an AI adoption strategy for engineering
- ✅ After a GitHub Copilot rollout, to measure real adoption
- ✅ As input for `/wizard-implementacao` (Implementation Guide of the main assessment)
- ✅ Quarterly, to track cultural evolution
- ✅ Before Copilot/AI workshops, to identify gaps

---

## 🔐 Anonymity: CRITICAL

This survey is **anonymous by design**:
- ❌ We do not ask for name, email, or corporate ID
- ✅ We only collect: role, years of experience, usage patterns, opinions
- ✅ Developers answer more honestly when they know it is anonymous
- ⚠️ In Microsoft Forms, **CHECK "Anonymous responses"** in Settings (without it, Forms captures the MS365 account email)

## 🛠️ How to build the Forms (step by step)

### Step 1 · Create the form

1. Go to <https://forms.office.com>
2. Click **+ New Form**
3. Suggested title: `Developer Survey: How my team uses GitHub & AI today`
4. Subtitle (paste this):

```
ANONYMOUS survey (20-25 min) about your practices with GitHub Copilot,
Copilot Chat modes (Ask/Edit/Agent), AI agents, instructions files,
AI + Dev best practices, and security.

Your answers will feed the team's AI adoption roadmap.
We do NOT ask for name or email, only role, years of experience, and patterns.

Estimated time: 20-25 min.
```

### Step 2 · ⚠️ CONFIGURE ANONYMITY

**Settings (gear ⚙️ in the top right corner):**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Anonymous responses** | ☑ **CHECKED** (CRITICAL: without it, Forms captures email!) |
| **Who can respond** | "Anyone with the link" (if cross-org) or "Only people in my organization" |
| **One response per person** | ☐ UNCHECKED (we want multiple) |
| **Accept responses** | ☑ CHECKED |
| **Email notification** | ☑ CHECKED (optional: you get notified on each response) |
| **Customize thank you message** | "Thank you! Your answers are being aggregated with the rest of the team." |

> 🔍 **How to confirm anonymity:** after creating it, open the link in a private window. If "Logged in as [your email]" does NOT appear at the top, it is anonymous.

### Step 3 · Create 9 sections

In Forms, button **+ Add new** → section icon (or "Add section"):

```
Section 1: S1 - Respondent profile            (7 questions)
Section 2: S2 - GitHub Copilot                (9 questions)
Section 3: S3 - Other Microsoft/GH tools      (7 questions)
Section 4: S4 - Development Practices         (9 questions)
Section 5: S5 - Agent Concepts                (11 questions)
Section 6: S6 - Markdown / Instructions       (6 questions)
Section 7: S7 - Usability                     (9 questions)
Section 8: S8 - Security and Governance       (13 questions)
Section 9: S9 - Pain Points & Wishlist        (4 questions)
```

### Step 4 · Add the 75 questions

Use the English bank [`perguntas-para-forms-devs.en.md`](perguntas-para-forms-devs.en.md) as the **copy/paste source**. The canonical question bank is the PT-BR version, [`perguntas-para-forms-devs.md`](perguntas-para-forms-devs.md); use it if your respondents answer in Portuguese. Each question has:
- **Type** (`choice`, `multi`, `text`)
- **ID** (`S2-Q1`, `S5-Q3`, etc.)
- **Question text**
- **Options** (for choice/multi)

**For each question in Forms:**

1. Type:
   - `choice` (Single answer) → **Choice** with "Multiple answers" UNCHECKED
   - `multi` (Multiple answers) → **Choice** with "Multiple answers" CHECKED
   - `text` (Long Text) → **Long answer**

2. **The question TITLE MUST start with the ID + colon**:
   ```
   S2-Q1: Do you have an active GitHub Copilot license?
   ```
   > ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** the ID is used by the `/importar-survey-devs` skill to map back to the schema. Do not remove or change the `SX-QY:` format.

3. **Options** (for choice/multi): paste the options listed in the MD, **one per line**, in order.

4. **Required**: mark as required only the 7 Profile questions (S1-Q1 to S1-Q7). Leave the rest optional (developers can skip them).

### Step 5 · Share

1. Button **+ Send / Collect responses** at the top
2. Choose **Link** (not Email, which breaks anonymity)
3. Copy the URL
4. Share via:
   - **Slack/Teams:** channel #engineering or #copilot-users
   - **Email to all developers:** "20-min anonymous survey: your opinion counts"
   - **All-hands:** project a QR code of the URL for developers to scan
5. **Suggested deadline:** 2 weeks. Remind once a week.

### Step 6 · Track responses

- The **Responses** tab shows the count in real time
- Recommended: **at least 5 respondents**, ideally **15+** for rich insights
- If participation is low: 1-on-1s with leaders to encourage it

### Step 7 · Export when you have enough responses

1. **Responses** tab → **Open in Excel** button
2. Save the file as **`respostas-survey-devs.xlsx`**
3. Move it to the **root of `kit-cliente/`** (not inside `survey-devs/`)
4. **Anonymity confirmed:** columns D (Email) and E (Name) must be empty

### Step 8 · Analyze with the kit

In Copilot Chat (Agent mode):

```
/importar-survey-devs
```

The skill:
- Detects `respostas-survey-devs.xlsx`
- Parses 75 questions × N respondents
- Generates `survey-devs/respostas-devs.json`
- Generates `saida/import-survey-log-<DATE>.md`

Then:

```
/insights-developer-survey
```

Generates an aggregated report in `saida/insights-developer-survey-<DATE>.md` (in **English by default**; the scripts accept `--lang pt-br` for Portuguese (Brazil)) with:
- Role distribution
- Top 5 most used Copilot features
- % adoption by mode (Ask/Edit/Agent/Workspace)
- Knowledge of concepts (agents, MCP, handoffs)
- Instructions files maturity
- Governance and security gaps
- Pain point citations (anonymized)
- Prioritized recommendations for the roadmap

## 🅱️ Alternative path: Excel/SharePoint directly (no Forms)

Faster if the team is small (3-5 developers) and technical.

1. Open `survey-devs/template-export-forms-devs.xlsx`
2. Delete the 5 mock respondent rows (rows 2-6) and keep row 1 (headers)
3. Save as `respostas-survey-devs.xlsx` and upload it to SharePoint with an "Anyone can edit" link
4. Each developer fills in **one row** with their answers (free text in the answer cells)
5. When everyone is done: download → move to the kit root → `/importar-survey-devs`

**Trade-off:** less visual than Forms, but zero setup. Suitable for technical teams.

## 💡 Collection best practices

### Launch with context
Do not drop the link in Slack without context. Create a moment:

> "Team, before we define the AI strategy for engineering next quarter, we want to hear how you use AI today. Anonymous 20-25 min survey with 75 questions (Copilot, agents, security, and more). Your answers go straight into the roadmap. Link: <URL>. Deadline: 2 weeks."

### Guarantee anonymity (for real)
- Confirm that Settings → Anonymous is CHECKED
- Do not force MS365 login (if you share it externally)
- In the aggregated report, never cite specific respondents, only patterns

### Remind periodically
- D+3: gentle reminder in the channel
- D+7: recap "X responses so far, Y days left"
- D+10: 1-on-1s with leaders to push
- D+14: final deadline + analysis starts

### Share the insights
Developers are more likely to answer the next survey if they see that the previous one led to action. After `/insights-developer-survey`:
- Present it at an all-hands
- Generate quick wins (workshop, prompt library, etc.)
- Repeat quarterly to measure evolution

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Diagnosis | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Skill does not detect the file | It is not at the root | Move `respostas-survey-devs.xlsx` to `kit-cliente/` (root) |
| Skill says "0 respondents" | Email/Name not empty but questions empty | Check that respondents answered at least 1 question |
| Headers not recognized | Missing "SX-QY:" at the start | Edit the headers manually to include the ID |
| Email shows up in Excel | Anonymity OFF | Reconfigure Forms → Settings → Anonymous Responses ON and resend |
| Low participation (< 5 responses) | Launched without context | Relaunch with a message from the leader, a deadline, and a purpose |

## Stuck on one of these steps?

<details>
<summary><strong>FAQ: common questions about the Developer Survey (anonymous)</strong></summary>

| Symptom | Likely cause | How to fix |
|---|---|---|
| Exported Excel has **Email** and **Name** filled in | **Anonymous responses** was NOT checked in Forms | Forms Settings → ✅ **Anonymous responses** → collect again |
| Developers complain it is too long (20-25 min) | Too many questions marked as required | Mark required **only in S1** (profile); leave the rest optional |
| I have fewer than 5 respondents | Insights are not very reliable | Absolute minimum: 3. Ideal: 5+. Great: 15+. Extend the campaign by 1 week |
| Skill computes maturity but the number looks low | Deterministic L0-L4 rubric: it reflects reality | See [`RUBRICA-MATURIDADE.md`](RUBRICA-MATURIDADE.md) to understand the scale |
| I want to skip this survey | That is fine: it is optional | Go straight to the Learning Survey or run only the main Assessment |
